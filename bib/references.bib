	abstract = {Since its introduction in the mid-1980s sonographic evaluation of the human fetal venous system has advanced dramatically. The venous system is well-recognized as a target for investigation in cases of circulatory compromise, and a broad spectrum of malformations affecting this system has been described. Appreciation of the normal embryology, anatomy and physiology of this system is essential to an understanding of structural anomalies and the sequential changes encountered in intrauterine growth restriction or other developmental disorders. We review the normal embryology, anatomy, and hemodynamics of the human fetal venous system, and provide an overview of Doppler investigation, as well as three- and four-dimensional ultrasound modalities and their application to this system.

	abstract = {This chapter deals with the anatomy and embryology of the venous system. It describes the histology of large veins, and presents a detailed anatomy of the veins of the trunk, and the upper and lower limbs. During embryogenesis, the earliest veins develop from capillary plexuses; these carry blood into the sinus venosus, the in-flow end of the forming heart. As far as the anatomy is concerned, the superior vena cava (SVC) starts at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins behind the first right costal cartilage, and ends at the level of the third right costal cartilage, where it drains into the right atrium. The dorsal and palmar digital veins join to form the metacarpal veins, which drain into the superficially located dorsal venous network of the hand. The cephalic and basilic veins arise from this network on the radial and ulnar side of the wrist, respectively. The inferior vena cava (IVC) begins at the confluence of the common iliac veins and ascends on the right side of the vertebral column, passes through the tendinous portion of the diaphragm, and after a short course (approximately 2.5 cm) in the chest, it terminates in the right atrium at the level of T9. In the upper abdomen, the IVC is located posterior to the duodenum, the head and neck of the pancreas, the lesser sac, and the liver.},

	abstract = {Mammalian left–right determination is a good example for how multiple cell biological processes coordinate in the formation of a basic body plan. The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left–right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of posteriorly tilted cilia that are built by transport via KIF3 motor on cells of the ventral node. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left–right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of sheathed lipidic particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the noncanonical hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca2+ and changes in gene expression., Right-to-left flow of fluid over the embryo sets up left–right (L/R) asymmetry in mammals. Cilia generate this “nodal flow,” restricting signals such as sonic hedgehog to one side.},

Establishment of this axis occurs early in embryogenesis before formation of the linear heart tube yet impacts upon much later morphogenetic events. In this review I discuss the differing mechanisms by which left-right polarity is achieved in the mouse and chick embryos and comment on the evolution of this system. I then discus three major classes of cardiovascular defect associated with aberrant left-right patterning seen in mouse mutants and human disease. I describe phenotypes associated with the determination of atrial identity and venous connections, looping morphogenesis of the heart tube and finally the asymmetric remodelling of the embryonic branchial arch arterial system to form the leftward looped arch of aorta and associated great arteries. Where appropriate, I consider left right patterning defects from an evolutionary perspective, demonstrating how developmental processes have been modified in species over time and illustrating how comparative embryology can aide in our understanding of congenital heart disease.},

	abstract = {The aorta has 2 main functions, conduit and cushion, and is designed to transmit blood to the periphery and buffer pulsatile stress from ventricular contraction. In the interaction between the structural and functional changes of the aorta, aging and disease processes impact on aortic material properties and hemodynamics. For a comprehensive assessment of changes in aortic structure and function associated with aging and disease, noninvasive cardiovascular imaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging, have recently been developed. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for direct and accurate measurement of different aortic characteristics including structural measures such as aortic area or volume, aortic length, curvature, and aortic wall thickness and functional measures such as aortic strain, distensibility, and pulse wave velocity. Excellent reproducibility of magnetic resonance imaging methods allows us to assess the response of the whole aorta to both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. Aortic flow and functional assessment could be added to clinical routine cardiac magnetic resonance as a comprehensive imaging modality primarily performed for the noninvasive evaluation of left ventricular function, left ventricular load, and vascular/ventricular coupling. New techniques such as 4-dimensional flow could provide and further elucidate the combined age-related effects of altered aortic geometry and function. This following review will describe the pathophysiological aspects of the aorta and the ability, value, and prospects of cardiovascular imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging, to study age-related changes in aortic structure and function and assess the relationship between these alterations and cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Objective: Both females and the elderly have been identified as vulnerable populations with increased injury and mortality risk in multiple crash scenarios. Particularly in frontal impacts, older females show higher risk to the chest and thorax than their younger or male counterparts. Thoracic geometry plays a role in this increase, and this study aims to quantify key parts of that geometry in a way that can directly inform human body models that incorporate the concept of person age.Methods: Computed tomography scans from 2 female subject groups aged 20–35 and 65–99 were selected from the International Center for Automotive Medicine scan database representing young and old female populations. A model of thoracic skeletal anatomy was built for each subject from independent parametric models of the spine, ribs, and sternum, along with further parametric models of those components’ spatial relationships. Parameter values between the 2 groups are directly compared, and average parameter values within each group are used to generate statistically average skeletal geometry for young and old females. In addition to the anatomic measures explicitly used in the parameterization scheme, key measures of rib cage depth and spine curvature are taken from both the underlying subject pool and from the resultant representative geometries.Results: Statistically significant differences were seen between the young and old groups’ spine and rib anatomic components, with no significant differences in local sternal geometry found. Vertebral segments in older females had higher angles relative to their inferior neighbors, providing a quantification of the kyphotic curvature known to be associated with age. Ribs in older females had greater end-to-end span, greater aspect ratio, and reduced out-of-plane deviation, producing an elongated and overall flatter curvature that leads to distal rib ends extending further anteriorly in older individuals. Combined differences in spine curvature and rib geometry led to an 18-mm difference in anterior placement of the sternum between young and old subjects.Conclusions: This study provides new geometric data regarding the variability in anthropometry of adult females with age and has utility in advancing the veracity of current human body models. A simplified scaffold representation of underlying 3-dimensional bones within the thorax is presented, and the reported young and old female parameter sets can be used to characterize the anatomic differences expected with age and to both validate and drive morphing algorithms for aged human body models. The modular approach taken allows model parameters to hold inherent and intuitive meaning, offering advantages over more generalized methods such as principal component analysis. Geometry can be assessed on a component level or a whole thorax level, and the parametric representation of thorax shape allows direct comparisons between the current study and other individuals or human body models.},

Since it is an easy bone to scan, it can be used for age and sex determination in forensic medicine. The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the sternum according to age and gender. Methods: This study was performed retrospectively on 700 CT images. 3D volume rendering images of sternum were created from the axial CT images at a 1 mm slice thickness. Results: There were significant differences in sternum measurements according to age and sex. The xiphoid process was identified under three different types. Ossification between the manubrium and sternum body showed significant differences according to age and sex. Conclusion: Data collected from a single bone is important for age and sex prediction especially in forensic medicine. These data taken from a large series may also contribute to evaluation of variations in sternal morphology.},

Therefore, knowledge of typical collateral vessel systems can provide insight in localizing venous obstruction and characterizing its severity and chronicity. In addition, knowledge of collateral anatomy can be essential in interventional procedural and/or surgical planning, especially when placing catheters in patients with venous blockage. In this pictorial review, we provide a systematic approach to understanding collateral pathways in patients with venous obstruction in the upper body.},
