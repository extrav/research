	abstract = {In the healthy patient, blood returns to the heart via classic venous pathways. Obstruction of any one of these pathways will result in blood flow finding new collateral pathways to return to the heart. Although significant anatomic variation exists and multiple collateral vessels are often present in the same patient, it is a general rule that the collateral pathways formed are a function of the site of venous blockage. Therefore, knowledge of typical collateral vessel systems can provide insight in localizing venous obstruction and characterizing its severity and chronicity. In addition, knowledge of collateral anatomy can be essential in interventional procedural and/or surgical planning, especially when placing catheters in patients with venous blockage. In this pictorial review, we provide a systematic approach to understanding collateral pathways in patients with venous obstruction in the upper body.},

Since it is an easy bone to scan, it can be used for age and sex determination in forensic medicine. The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the sternum according to age and gender. Methods: This study was performed retrospectively on 700 CT images. 3D volume rendering images of sternum were created from the axial CT images at a 1 mm slice thickness. Results: There were significant differences in sternum measurements according to age and sex. The xiphoid process was identified under three different types. Ossification between the manubrium and sternum body showed significant differences according to age and sex. Conclusion: Data collected from a single bone is important for age and sex prediction especially in forensic medicine. These data taken from a large series may also contribute to evaluation of variations in sternal morphology.},

	abstract = {Objective: Both females and the elderly have been identified as vulnerable populations with increased injury and mortality risk in multiple crash scenarios. Particularly in frontal impacts, older females show higher risk to the chest and thorax than their younger or male counterparts. Thoracic geometry plays a role in this increase, and this study aims to quantify key parts of that geometry in a way that can directly inform human body models that incorporate the concept of person age.Methods: Computed tomography scans from 2 female subject groups aged 20–35 and 65–99 were selected from the International Center for Automotive Medicine scan database representing young and old female populations. A model of thoracic skeletal anatomy was built for each subject from independent parametric models of the spine, ribs, and sternum, along with further parametric models of those components’ spatial relationships. Parameter values between the 2 groups are directly compared, and average parameter values within each group are used to generate statistically average skeletal geometry for young and old females. In addition to the anatomic measures explicitly used in the parameterization scheme, key measures of rib cage depth and spine curvature are taken from both the underlying subject pool and from the resultant representative geometries.Results: Statistically significant differences were seen between the young and old groups’ spine and rib anatomic components, with no significant differences in local sternal geometry found. Vertebral segments in older females had higher angles relative to their inferior neighbors, providing a quantification of the kyphotic curvature known to be associated with age. Ribs in older females had greater end-to-end span, greater aspect ratio, and reduced out-of-plane deviation, producing an elongated and overall flatter curvature that leads to distal rib ends extending further anteriorly in older individuals. Combined differences in spine curvature and rib geometry led to an 18-mm difference in anterior placement of the sternum between young and old subjects.Conclusions: This study provides new geometric data regarding the variability in anthropometry of adult females with age and has utility in advancing the veracity of current human body models. A simplified scaffold representation of underlying 3-dimensional bones within the thorax is presented, and the reported young and old female parameter sets can be used to characterize the anatomic differences expected with age and to both validate and drive morphing algorithms for aged human body models. The modular approach taken allows model parameters to hold inherent and intuitive meaning, offering advantages over more generalized methods such as principal component analysis. Geometry can be assessed on a component level or a whole thorax level, and the parametric representation of thorax shape allows direct comparisons between the current study and other individuals or human body models.},

	abstract = {The aorta has 2 main functions, conduit and cushion, and is designed to transmit blood to the periphery and buffer pulsatile stress from ventricular contraction. In the interaction between the structural and functional changes of the aorta, aging and disease processes impact on aortic material properties and hemodynamics. For a comprehensive assessment of changes in aortic structure and function associated with aging and disease, noninvasive cardiovascular imaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging, have recently been developed. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for direct and accurate measurement of different aortic characteristics including structural measures such as aortic area or volume, aortic length, curvature, and aortic wall thickness and functional measures such as aortic strain, distensibility, and pulse wave velocity. Excellent reproducibility of magnetic resonance imaging methods allows us to assess the response of the whole aorta to both pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. Aortic flow and functional assessment could be added to clinical routine cardiac magnetic resonance as a comprehensive imaging modality primarily performed for the noninvasive evaluation of left ventricular function, left ventricular load, and vascular/ventricular coupling. New techniques such as 4-dimensional flow could provide and further elucidate the combined age-related effects of altered aortic geometry and function. This following review will describe the pathophysiological aspects of the aorta and the ability, value, and prospects of cardiovascular imaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging, to study age-related changes in aortic structure and function and assess the relationship between these alterations and cardiovascular disease.},

In this review I discuss the differing mechanisms by which left-right polarity is achieved in the mouse and chick embryos and comment on the evolution of this system. I then discus three major classes of cardiovascular defect associated with aberrant left-right patterning seen in mouse mutants and human disease. I describe phenotypes associated with the determination of atrial identity and venous connections, looping morphogenesis of the heart tube and finally the asymmetric remodelling of the embryonic branchial arch arterial system to form the leftward looped arch of aorta and associated great arteries. Where appropriate, I consider left right patterning defects from an evolutionary perspective, demonstrating how developmental processes have been modified in species over time and illustrating how comparative embryology can aide in our understanding of congenital heart disease.},

	abstract = {This chapter deals with the anatomy and embryology of the venous system. It describes the histology of large veins, and presents a detailed anatomy of the veins of the trunk, and the upper and lower limbs. During embryogenesis, the earliest veins develop from capillary plexuses; these carry blood into the sinus venosus, the in-flow end of the forming heart. As far as the anatomy is concerned, the superior vena cava (SVC) starts at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins behind the first right costal cartilage, and ends at the level of the third right costal cartilage, where it drains into the right atrium. The dorsal and palmar digital veins join to form the metacarpal veins, which drain into the superficially located dorsal venous network of the hand. The cephalic and basilic veins arise from this network on the radial and ulnar side of the wrist, respectively. The inferior vena cava (IVC) begins at the confluence of the common iliac veins and ascends on the right side of the vertebral column, passes through the tendinous portion of the diaphragm, and after a short course (approximately 2.5 cm) in the chest, it terminates in the right atrium at the level of T9. In the upper abdomen, the IVC is located posterior to the duodenum, the head and neck of the pancreas, the lesser sac, and the liver.},

The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left–right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of posteriorly tilted cilia that are built by transport via KIF3 motor on cells of the ventral node. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left–right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of sheathed lipidic particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the noncanonical hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca2+ and changes in gene expression., Right-to-left flow of fluid over the embryo sets up left–right (L/R) asymmetry in mammals. Cilia generate this “nodal flow,” restricting signals such as sonic hedgehog to one side.},

	abstract = {Aging is a continuous process that induces many alterations in the cytoarchitecture of different organs and systems both in humans and animals. Moreover, it is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic processes. The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ responsible for the production of immunocompetent T cells and, with aging, it atrophies and declines in functions. Universality of thymic involution in all species possessing thymus, including human, indicates it as a long-standing evolutionary event. Although it is accepted that many factors contribute to age-associated thymic involution, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the process. The exact time point of the initiation is not well defined. To address the issue, we report the exact age of thymus throughout the review so that readers can have a nicely pictured synoptic view of the process. Focusing our attention on the different stages of the development of the thymus gland (natal, postnatal, adult, and old), we describe chronologically the morphological changes of the gland. We report that the thymic morphology and cell types are evolutionarily preserved in several vertebrate species. This finding is important in understanding the similar problems caused by senescence and other diseases. Another point that we considered very important is to indicate the assessment of the thymus through radiological images to highlight its variability in shape, size, and anatomical conformation.},

The required mechanical compatibility of the prepared scaffold with native trachea necessitates investigation of the mechanical behavior of the human trachea. This study aimed at mechanical characterization of human tracheas and comparing the results based on age and gender. After isolating 30 human tracheas, samples of tracheal cartilage, smooth muscle, and connective tissue were subjected to uniaxial tension to obtain force-displacement curves and calculate stress-stretch data. Among several models, the Yeoh and Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic functions were best able to describe hyperelastic behavior of all three tracheal components. The mean value of the elastic modulus of human tracheal cartilage was calculated to be 16.92 ± 8.76 MPa. An overall tracheal stiffening with age was observed, with the most considerable difference in the case of cartilage. Consistently, we noticed some histological alterations in cartilage and connective tissue with aging, which may play a role in age-related tracheal stiffening. No considerable effect of gender on the mechanical behavior of tracheal components was observed. The results of this study can be applied in the design and fabrication of trachea tissue engineering scaffolds.},

	abstract = {Most studies on the effect of aging on esophageal motor function have shown that peristaltic function deteriorates with age. Esophageal motor function is traditionally studied by means of manometry and radiography. Distension of the esophagus with evaluation of active and passive mechanical parameters have become available during recent years. In this study, we did a manometric swallow analysis and used the distension method to study esophageal properties and function during aging. An impedance planimetric probe with a bag for distension was placed in the distal esophagus of 25 healthy volunteers with a median age of 35 (range 23-86) years. Distensions were done at an infusion rate of 25 ml min-1 with and without relaxation of neuromuscular activity with butylscopolamine. The infusion was reversed when moderate pain was experienced by the subjects. Swallow-induced contraction amplitudes decreased as function of age for persons older than 40 years (P {\textless} 0.05). The total and passive tension showed an exponential increase as function of the change in radius, whereas the active tension increased until it reached a local maximum point. The maximum active tension deteriorated as a function of age after the age of 40 years (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, esophagus became stiffer with age. In conclusion, age-related changes of increased stiffness and reduced primary and secondary peristalsis were found in the human esophagus with a deterioration of esophageal function after the age of 40 years. Such changes may contribute to the high prevalence of reflux disease in elderly. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

OBJECTIVE. For this study, we reviewed 56 standard-of-care CT examinations over a timespan of 2 years from patients with superior thoracic inlet venous obstruction and identified eight thoracic collateral pathways for venous blood return to the right heart. We evaluated each pathway individually from an anatomic and a pathophysiologic perspective for a better understanding of how such pathways form and what patterns can be expected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. All 56 patients were scanned according to our standard CT protocol. Images of the thoracic region were acquired in the craniocaudal direction during breath-holding using a second-generation dual-source CT scanner. Contrast medium was administered via a cubital or antecubital vein; the amount of contrast material ranged from 49 to 81 mL depending on patient body weight.

RESULTS. Of the 56 patients, CT showed superior vena cava syndrome exclusively in 22 (39\%) patients and showed superior vena cava syndrome and involvement of the left or right brachiocephalic vein or even the subclavian vein in the remaining 34 (61\%) patients. We could not find any remarkable feature leading to the formation of only one collateral pathway or to a specific pattern depending on underlying cause or the level or the extent of obstruction. Thus, we believe that there are no specific patterns for how these venous detours form and that they are most probably driven by pressure gradients.

CONCLUSION. Recognizing imaging findings associated with venous collateral pathways may prevent misdiagnosis or unnecessary follow-up examinations. Furthermore, knowledge of these collateral pathways and an understanding of the underlying cause can support interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons in planning interventional procedures and revascularization procedures.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are frequently asymptomatic. They are often not diagnosed clinically or radiologically. Despite this, prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures predict future osteoporotic fractures and are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Appropriate management of osteoporosis can reduce future fracture risk. Fractures on lateral chest radiographs taken for other conditions are frequently overlooked by radiologists. Our aim was to assess the value of computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of vertebral fracture and identify the frequency with which significant fractures are missed.
Materials and methods
The thoracic CT scans of 100 consecutive male and 100 consecutive female patients over 55 years were reviewed. CT images were acquired on General Electric Lightspeed multi-detector (MD) CT scanners (16 or 32 row) using 1.25mm slice thickness. Midline sagittal images were reconstructed from the 3D volume images. The presence of moderate (25–40\% height loss) or severe ({\textgreater}40\% height loss) vertebral fractures between T1 and L1 was determined using an established semi-quantitative method and confirmed by morphological measurement. Results were compared with the formal CT report.
Results
Scans of 192 patients were analysed (95 female; 97 male); mean age 70.1 years. Thirty-eight (19.8\%) patients had one or more moderate to severe vertebral fractures. Only 5 (13\%) were correctly reported as having osteoporotic fractures in the official report. The sensitivity of axial CT images to vertebral fracture was 0.35.
Conclusion
Incidental osteoporotic vertebral fractures are under-reported on CT. The sensitivity of axial images in detecting these fractures is poor. Sagittal reformations are strongly recommended to improve the detection rate.},

	abstract = {Abnormal extracranial venous drainage modality has been considered an etiology of transient global amnesia (TGA). Evidence suggests that the transmission of the intrathoracic/intraabdominal pressure during a Valsalva maneuver (VM) is mainly through the vertebral venous system, and patency of internal jugular vein (IJV) is essential for venous drainage and pressure releasing. We hypothesize that obstruction of IJV venous drainage is a contributing factor in TGA pathogenesis. A magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol was used in 45 TGA patients and 45 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the morphologies of IJV, brachiocephalic vein (BCV) and asymmetry of transverse sinus (TS). The IJV was divided into the upper- and middle-IJV segments. Compared to the controls, TGA patients had significantly higher rates of moderate and severe compression/stenosis at the bilateral upper-IJV segment (left: 37.8\% vs. 17.8\%, P = 0.0393; right: 57.8\% vs.15.6\%, P{\textless}0.0012), in left BCV (60\% vs. 8.9\%, P{\textless}0.0004), and in TS hypoplasia (53.3\%\% vs. 31.1\%, P = 0.0405). The prevalence of at least one site of venous compression/stenosis in IJV or BCV was significantly higher in patients than in controls (91.1\% vs. 33.3\%, P{\textless}0.0004). The diameter of the left TS in MRV, but not in T1 contrast imaging, was significantly smaller in TGA patients than in controls (0.31 ± 0.21 vs. 0.41 ± 0.19, P = 0.0290), which was compatible with downstream venous stenosis/obstruction. TGA patients have a higher prevalence of compression/stenosis of the bilateral IJV and the left BCV and TS hypoplasia, which is new evidence that supports the role of extracranial veins in TGA pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background:
The extracranial venous outflow routes in clinically defined multiple sclerosis (CDMS) have not previously been investigated.

Methods:
Sixty-five patients affected by CDMS, and 235 controls composed, respectively, of healthy subjects, healthy subjects older than CDMS patients, patients affected by other neurological diseases and older controls not affected by neurological diseases but scheduled for venography (HAV-C) blindly underwent a combined transcranial and extracranial colour-Doppler high-resolution examination (TCCS-ECD) aimed at detecting at least two of five parameters of anomalous venous outflow. According to the TCCS-ECD screening, patients and HAV-C further underwent selective venography of the azygous and jugular venous system with venous pressure measurement.

Results:
CDMS and TCCS-ECD venous outflow anomalies were dramatically associated (OR 43, 95\% CI 29 to 65, p{\textless}0.0001). Subsequently, venography demonstrated in CDMS, and not in controls, the presence of multiple severe extracranial stenosis, affecting the principal cerebrospinal venous segments; this provides a picture of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) with four different patterns of distribution of stenosis and substitute circle. Moreover, relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive courses were associated with CCSVI patterns significantly different from those of primary progressive (p{\textless}0.0001). Finally, the pressure gradient measured across the venous stenosies was slightly but significantly higher.

Conclusion:
CDMS is strongly associated with CCSVI, a scenario that has not previously been described, characterised by abnormal venous haemodynamics determined by extracranial multiple venous strictures of unknown origin. The location of venous obstructions plays a key role in determining the clinical course of the disease.},

The first consensus guidelines have been published on investigation and management of adult IIH and one key area of uncertainty is the utility of dural venous sinus stenting for the management of headache and visual loss. There are an increasing number of series published and to help understand the successes and complications. During a patient physician priority setting, the understanding of the best type of intervention to treat IIH was assigned to the top 10 of most desired research questions for the disease. Ultimately randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in neurovascular stenting for IIH would be instructive, as the literature to date may suffer from publication bias. Due to the increasing incidence of IIH, there is no better time to systematically investigate interventions that may reverse the disease process and achieve remission. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of IIH in relation to venous sinus stenosis, the role of venous sinus stenting with a review of the relevant literature, the advantages and disadvantages of stenting compared with other surgical interventions, and the future of stenting in the treatment of IIH.Keywords: pseudotumor cerebri, raised intracranial pressure, venous sinus stenosis, neurovascular stenting, headache, papilloedema},

	abstract = {The brain is the command center of the body that regulates the vital functions of circulation, respiration, motor function, metabolic activities, or autonomic nervous system outcomes. The brain coordinates these continuous activities at the expense of huge energy utilization. This energy demand is achieved by active transport of nutrients across the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB). This review discusses the barrier interfaces in the CNS that include the BBB, blood-spinal cord barrier, the epithelial choroid plexus, and the epithelial arachnoid. While transporting of nutrients across the BBB is a normal physiological function, the trafficking of xenobiotics and inflammatory cells/agents across these interfaces is harmful to brain cells. This leads to production of waste metabolites in the brain. Clearance of these waste metabolites maintains the normal brain homeostasis, while aggregation is detrimental to neurological complications. Since the CNS lacks lymphatic system, the CSF serves as the clearance path for water-soluble peptides/solutes, but not large size waste metabolites like Aβ protein. In particular, this review will focus on the mechanisms of waste metabolites clearance paths in the CNS. This will include the recently discovered waste metabolites movement from interstitial space (IS) directly into perivascular clearance (PVC), or via IS-CSF-PVC, and its exchange from PVC to circulation. Concluding remarks will discuss the therapeutic approach to improve the clearance mechanisms for ameliorating neurological diseases.},

To investigate the effect of removal of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar “tap test” on the cerebral circulation in patients with iNPH, 14 patients with “probable” iNPH were studied using a novel blood tracking technique based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance signal intensity. By tracking the propagation of the low-frequency component of the BOLD signal, extended venous drainage times were observed in the periventricular region of the patients, which was reversed by tap test. Interestingly, the venous drainage time in the periventricular region exhibited an age-related prolongation in the healthy control group. Additional regression analyses involving 81 control subjects revealed a dissociation of deep and superficial venous systems with increasing age, presumably reflecting focal inefficiency in the deep system. Our results not only provide insights into the etiology of iNPH, but also point to a potential non-invasive biomarker for screening iNPH.},
